# EBE 295/395 Elective- Circuit Simulation and Optimization Methods: A Power Systems Perspective

This repository will house all projects for the course. Follow the setup and submission instructions outlined below.

## Projects
For each project you work on, please use the appropriate project branch.
- Project 1 Branch - project1
- Project 2 Branch - project2
- Project 3 Branch - project3

Any test cases, readers, or parsers that we are giving to you to complete a project will be on their respective 
project branch.

I encourage students to use Linux - Ubuntu platform for this prohect because most of the project files were designed for it

## Setting my linux/unix environment
- Windows users please install WSL through following link [Install WSL for Windows User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Download and use Windows terminal and install Python.
- Mac users can just install Python and we can get started.
- Linux users. Just install Python and we can get started.

## Supplementary Material to Get Started 
We have two suggested resources for review before the course begins on Wednesday. First, we will be working with matrices often in this course, so basic familiarity with matrix indexing and operations is expected, and we suggest reviewing this linear algebra refresher from:

[Linear Algebra Refresher](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/index.html)
[Linear Algebra Notes](docs/linear-algebra-notes.pdf)

You will use Python to complete course projects. Therefore, we expect you to be comfortable with object oriented programming in Python. Going through the following link prior to class starting will make the projects go much more smoothly:

[Python Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

Lastly, please sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you do not already have one.

## Git Help
Working on these projects will require you to have some knowledge of Git. If you've never used Git before or need a 
refresher, check out the [GitHub Git cheat sheet](docs/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) and the [NDP Software Git 
Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace;).
